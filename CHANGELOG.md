# Changelog

## 1.2.22 - 2026-10-26

- Slide a workspace in over the real wallpaper and desktop icons when no recent capture of it exists. A window closing, moving, or restarting there, or an engine restart, discards that capture, and the rebuilt frame used to show a near-black screen until the windows appeared
- Capture each monitor's desktop at startup, after wallpaper or work-area changes, and every five minutes while the user pauses
- Stop snapshotting hidden windows, which print as solid black, so a maximized app on another workspace no longer slides in as a black screen after an engine restart
- Draw only each window's visible frame, so floating windows have no black resize border in the slide
- Add desktop-background regression tests

## 1.2.21 - 2026-10-25

- Stop adopting on-screen displays, tray flyouts, notifications, tooltips, menus, and meeting or screen-sharing overlays as workspace windows, so a Caps Lock indicator no longer gets stuck on screen after a workspace visit
- Keep focusing a Zoom share toolbar, annotation bar, or similar overlay, or opening the tray overflow, from switching the monitor to another workspace
- Leave Zoom's screen-sharing toolbar and share preview on screen across workspaces. The toolbar has a taskbar button but is owned by a sharing overlay or a hidden toolbar holder, so every owner up the chain is now checked
- Release an adopted window once its app turns it into an overlay, and never switch workspaces when one is focused; Zoom attaches its share toolbar to the sharing overlay only after showing it
- Log window captures and animation frames that stall, to pinpoint slowdowns during screen sharing
- Release such windows saved by earlier versions on startup without popping them back up
- Limit restart memory to apps' top-level windows, so a newly opened dialog or popup is no longer hidden as the "restart" of one closed on another workspace
- Keep the debug log open instead of reopening it for every line, which took about 8 ms each and made up most of a workspace switch's delay
- Check visibility first in the 250 ms window scan
- Add transient-window regression tests

## 1.2.20 - 2026-10-23

- Prevent an app that stops responding from freezing the whole workspace engine, including its watchdog and hotkeys
- Check each app's UI thread before window captures, focus restores, and stack reordering; capture hung windows from the screen and post requests to them instead of waiting
- Skip snapshots of windows that are not on screen
- Stop restarts from popping up windows their own apps had hidden, such as tray apps, popups, and tooltips, or treating them as hidden by the engine
- Release windows that an app keeps hidden after a visit, so switches no longer wait on them until timing out
- Rotate the debug log during long sessions instead of only at startup
- Add hung-app and self-hidden-window regression tests, and fix test wrappers under Windows PowerShell 5.1

## 1.2.19 - 2026-09-20

- Prevent overlapping desktop-indicator updates from leaving a stale D-number permanently visible
- Tie dismissal callbacks to their own indicator and remove expired or incorrect labels during health checks
- Clear indicators on reset and shutdown; add native-window regression coverage for overlapping updates and cleanup

## 1.2.18 - 2026-09-12

- Return apps that restart within ten minutes to their previous workspace on the same monitor, including common updater version-folder changes
- Detect replacement windows in the background and suppress initial restart focus requests without switching the user's active workspace
- Avoid guessing when an app spans workspaces, consume one remembered assignment per replacement, and clear restart memory on reset
- Add regression coverage for replacement handles/processes, update paths, multiple windows, ambiguity, expiry, and taskbar activation

## 1.2.17 - 2026-09-09

- Animate left/right workspace switching while carrying a held window
- Keep the live held window above the slide and omit it from both desktop frames so no duplicate slides away

## 1.2.16 - 2026-09-09

- Suppress the overview mouse corner while a fullscreen or borderless fullscreen app is focused, including when the pointer reaches another monitor
- Keep the overview keyboard shortcut available during fullscreen use

## 1.2.15 - 2026-09-08

- Keep a held window visible and carry it into the selected workspace when switching during a native window drag
- Switch instantly during dragging and restore incoming windows behind the held window without activating them
- Finalize assignments on drop, including moves across monitors, and suppress the overview hot corner while the mouse button is held

## 1.2.14 - 2026-09-02

- Added hard boundaries to previous/next workspace navigation so D3 cannot wrap to D1 and D1 cannot wrap to D3
- Applied the same boundary behavior to rapid queued switching requests

## 1.2.13 - 2026-09-02

- Added an Explorer-owned `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R` recovery hotkey to the installed Startup shortcut
- Made manual recovery launch the workspace engine even when its AutoHotkey process has already crashed or stopped
- Resolved packaged-app filesystem redirection to physical runtime and script paths before writing Windows shortcuts
- Anchored installed logs and saved workspace state to the resolved script location so installer and Explorer launches share the same data
- Added recovery-hotkey validation to both WScript and native Unicode shortcut installer paths
- Corrected the startup D-number indicator to show the active workspace on the monitor under the pointer

## 1.2.12 - 2026-09-01

- Added a transition watchdog that accelerates and retries a switch when progress stalls
- Added automatic engine restart after a prolonged stuck transition, preserving the last known-good state and replaying the requested D-number after startup
- Caught switch-time runtime errors and routed them through the same restart-and-resume recovery path
- Added `Win+Ctrl+Shift+R` and a tray command for manual engine restart without clearing workspace assignments
- Added switch heartbeat, soft recovery, hard recovery, restart, and recovery-replay diagnostics

## 1.2.11 - 2026-09-01

- Moved the complete workspace engine into per-monitor-v2 DPI awareness instead of applying it only to animation windows
- Unified monitor bounds, screen capture, GDI back buffers, and presentation surfaces in physical-pixel coordinates
- Added startup DPI-context diagnostics to distinguish each monitor's actual 96, 120, or 168 DPI rendering path

## 1.2.10 - 2026-09-01

- Created slide and taskbar-shield windows under per-monitor-v2 DPI awareness
- Sized animation surfaces while hidden with native physical-pixel coordinates, eliminating the scaled frame that appeared as a zoom before switching
- Added client-area, window-bounds, and window-DPI diagnostics for every slide and taskbar shield

## 1.2.9 - 2026-09-01

- Intercepted mouse clicks only within Windows taskbar app-button controls before Explorer activates the selected app
- Captured and displayed the current workspace before forwarding the click, preventing the selected app from flashing on the wrong D-number
- Handed the frozen pre-click frame directly into the standard directional workspace animation
- Restored smooth taskbar-triggered D3-to-D1 slides while retaining instant adoption as a fallback for non-taskbar activation

## 1.2.8 - 2026-09-01

- Replaced taskbar-triggered slide replay with an instant logical workspace adoption
- Kept the taskbar-selected app continuously visible instead of hiding and reopening it
- Updated outgoing and incoming window groups behind the selected app, then restored its top position
- Removed all external-activation slide frames to eliminate the visible “open here, then switch there” sequence

## 1.2.7 - 2026-09-01

- Replaced timer-only taskbar detection with a native Windows foreground-event hook
- Re-hid externally activated workspace windows immediately, before DWM presents them on the wrong workspace
- Prevented the premature app frame from entering the outgoing workspace capture
- Retained a faster polling fallback and deduplicated event/poll activation handling

## 1.2.6 - 2026-09-01

- Detected taskbar and other external foreground activation of apps assigned to an inactive workspace
- Converted an external app reveal into a real workspace transition, including the D-number indicator and persisted current-workspace state
- Promoted and refocused the exact selected app after its workspace finishes switching
- Added a taskbar-activation regression preview covering a D3-to-D1 Codex selection

## 1.2.5 - 2026-09-01

- Kept the completed animation frame visible until every incoming application acknowledges its show request
- Preserved and restored each workspace's complete window Z-order so repeated switches do not change which overlapping or maximized app is on top
- Persisted workspace window stacks across app restarts and installer updates
- Added handoff acknowledgement, retry, and stack diagnostics plus an eight-switch regression loop

## 1.2.4 - 2026-09-01

- Isolated visual regression preview modes from persistent user workspace state
- Excluded Windows XAML host and Raycast launcher/shutdown helper surfaces from workspace assignment

## 1.2.3 - 2026-09-01

- Accepted workspace hotkeys during an active animation instead of rejecting them
- Coalesced repeated input to the latest requested workspace and calculated Left/Right from that requested state
- Accelerated an in-progress slide to its final frame when another request arrives on the same monitor
- Added a shorter 190 ms transition for queued rapid-switch destinations
- Added automated interrupted-animation testing and queue/acceleration diagnostics

## 1.2.2 - 2026-09-01

- Replaced moving full-resolution Picture controls with a single custom-rendered animation surface
- Added a persistent 1:1-pixel GDI back buffer and one-operation frame presentation to eliminate child-control erase and rescale flicker
- Synchronized animation presentation with Desktop Window Manager and suppressed background erase messages

## 1.2.1 - 2026-09-01

- Replaced transparent per-window animation controls with two opaque, monitor-sized workspace frames
- Locked the outgoing and incoming frame edges to the same pixel throughout the slide, eliminating background gaps caused by independent rounding
- Reduced repaint work to two full-frame controls and disabled background erase during animation redraws
- Cached complete workspace frames and invalidated them when window assignments change

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-01

- Added a 340 ms directional workspace slide using captured window surfaces, with cubic ease-in-out motion
- Higher-numbered workspaces enter from the right while the current workspace exits left; lower-numbered workspaces use the reverse direction
- Kept real application windows stationary during animation so maximized windows and saved positions are not disturbed
- Removed opacity animation from the D-number indicator
- Added an automatic bidirectional slide preview for runtime regression testing

## 1.1.5 - 2026-09-01

- Excluded Windows input and Widgets helper windows from workspace management

## 1.1.4 - 2026-09-01

- Fixed a re-entrant D-number overlay cleanup race that could raise `Item has no value` while rapidly switching workspaces
- Excluded Raycast's UI-access helper window because it is not an app window and rejects normal workspace hide requests

## 1.1.3 - 2026-09-01

- Added persistent diagnostic logging for monitor state, window assignments, overview hit-testing, workspace transitions, show/hide calls, activation retries, and post-switch verification
- Added bounded log rotation at 4 MB and an `Open debug log` tray command

- Prevented a selected app from being shown if another workspace becomes active during the activation delay
- Refreshed the `D1`, `D2`, or `D3` indicator after focusing an app selected from the overview

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-01

- Fixed overview window clicks to switch using the overview's original monitor instead of re-detecting the pointer target
- Restored and showed the exact selected window synchronously after switching workspaces
